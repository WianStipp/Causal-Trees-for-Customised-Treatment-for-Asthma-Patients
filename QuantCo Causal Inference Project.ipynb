Let $Y_i(z)$ be the score (1 = satisfactory, 0 = non-satisfactory) given by patient $i$ for the treatment recieved by physician} \\\\ \\text{ group $z \\in \\{1,2\\}$}}$ \\\\\n",

    "$\\text{Comorbidity is defined as: the presence of one or more additional conditions co-occurring with a primary condition; in the countable} \\\\ \\text{sense of the term, a comorbidity is each additional condition. The additional condition may also be a behavioral or mental disorder.}$\n",

That is if $p_z$ is} \\\\ \\text{the fraction of patients that would be satisfied with the service of $z$ if all patients were treated by the same, then we want to find $p_1 - p_2$.}}$\n",
